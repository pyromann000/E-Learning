            <li>It describes the ability of an object to hide its data and methods.</li>
            <li>Encapsulation is also known as “data hiding.”</li><br>

            <b>BENEFITS OF ENCAPSULATION:</b> <br>
            <li>It improves maintainability, flexibility, and reusability.</li>
            <li>The fields can be made read-only or write-only.</li>
            <li>It restricts access only to those features of an object that are declared public.</li><br>

            <li>In Java, a class encapsulates the fields that hold an object's state and the methods that define the object's actions.</li>
            <li>Fields are encapsulated by declaring instance variables private and methods public.</li>
            <li>An accessor or a getter method is a public method that returns data from a private instance variable.</li>
            <li>A mutator or a setter method is a public method that changes the data stored in one or more private instance variables.</li><br>
            </ul>

            <b>RULES IN IMPLEMENTING ENCAPSULATION</b> <br>
                1. Instance variables are declared private.<br>
                Ex. private String name;<br>
                2. Names of getter methods begin with get if the property is not a<br>
                boolean.<br>
                Ex. public String getName() {<br>
                return name;<br>
                }<br>
                3. Names of getter methods begin with is if the property is a boolean.<br>
                Ex. public boolean isEnrolled() {<br>
                return status;<br>
                }<br>
                4. Names of setter methods begin with set.<br>
                Ex. public void setName(String name) {<br>
                this.name = name;<br>
                }<br>
            </p>

<strong>ABSTRACTION</strong> - Abstraction is a fundamental concept in software development that involves simplifying complex systems
by focusing on essential characteristics while hiding unnecessary details.<br>

<b>Fundamentals</b><br>

Data abstraction is the process of hiding certain details and showing only essential information to the user.<br>
Abstraction can be achieved with either abstract classes or interfaces.<br>
• The abstract keyword is a non-access modifier, used for classes and methods:<br>
Abstract class: is a restricted class that cannot be used to create objects (to access it, it must be inherited from another class).<br>

 Abstract method: can only be used in an abstract class, and it does not have a body. The body is provided by the subclass (inherited from).<br><br>
• An abstract class can have both abstract and regular methods:<br>
• An abstract class is created to ensure that subclasses will implement necessary methods.<br><br>
